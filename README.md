# Chordy
Chord Pro organiser and PDF generator.

Chordy started out as a need to be able to transpose ChordPro files easily. I also wanted the ability to format ChordPro files and use coloured backgrounds.
I decided to use the PDF format as the final output as this allows you to specify any weird and wonderful fonts you may like.
The final result (so far) is a package that will do all the above and gives you control over all the visual parameters.
Chordy includes my ChordPro editor (which is also available standalone) which just makes editing Chordpro files easier. It will also take existing chord text - where the chords are placed on a seperate line above the lyrics - and have a good attempt at converting it to ChordPro format.
Chordy requires ActiveState Tk/Tcl to be installed - the original version just used Tk for the graphic interface but this was limiting when I tried to port things to the Mac world. Chordy now runs on both.

Included with the package is my first attempt at a Tab editor. It handles most of the sorts of things you'd expect from a Tab editor but I'm sure there are some glaring omission! The Windows version will also play all or selected parts of the Tab - useful for practicing and/or checking any timing issues. This is not (yet) avaiable on the Mac version.
